# Developer-Profile-Generator

This application is prompting the user to enter a GitHub username to fully showing the person information such as the number of followers and following, GitHub stars, and public repositories. Then, it will prompt for a color that the user wants for their profile. Once that's done, a PDF file of the searched person will get generated. This app is created with HTML, CSS, JS, and Node.js.
